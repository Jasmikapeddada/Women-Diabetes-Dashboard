# 📊 Reducing Women's Diabetes Rates – A Data-Driven Approach  

## 📝 Project Overview  
This project explores **key factors contributing to diabetes in women** and provides **data-driven recommendations** for prevention. Using the **Women's Diabetes Dataset from Kaggle**, I performed **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization** to extract meaningful insights. The final output is an **interactive Excel dashboard** designed to highlight critical trends.  

## 🔍 Key Findings  
- **40%** of women have diabetes, and **35%** are prediabetic.  
- Young adults (**131 cases**) now have a **higher diabetes rate** than middle-aged women (**120 cases**).  
- **64%** of women are overweight or obese, significantly increasing diabetes risk.  
- **21%** have hypertension, further contributing to diabetes.  
- Strong **correlation between BMI and glucose levels**, emphasizing obesity as a major risk factor.  

## 💡 Data-Driven Recommendations  
✅ **Target Young Adults** – Awareness campaigns & healthy lifestyle programs.  
✅ **Promote Weight Management** – Encourage balanced diets and physical activity.  
✅ **Monitor Blood Pressure** – Reduce salt intake & stress to prevent hypertension.  
✅ **Prevent Prediabetes Progression** – Routine glucose checks & early intervention strategies.  

## 🚀 Technologies Used  
- **Excel** – Data cleaning, analysis, and dashboard creation.  
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handling missing values and duplicates.  
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** – Identifying patterns and trends.  
- **Data Visualization** – Creating pivot tables and charts for insights.
